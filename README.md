# Epitech Project -> First year, my_sokoban

## Description
This project is a Sokoban game developed in C language for Unix systems, completed as part of the B1 - Unix System Programming course. Sokoban is a puzzle game where the player moves boxes in a warehouse to place them on storage locations. The game was implemented using the ncurses library to create a terminal-based user interface, providing an immersive gaming experience.

## Features
- Faithful recreation of the classic Sokoban game.
- Terminal-based user interface using the ncurses library.
- Implementation of game mechanics using arrays to represent the game board.
- Efficient manipulation of game elements facilitated by array representation.
- Ability to develop programming skills and utilize third-party libraries like ncurses to create interactive terminal-based applications.

## Usage
To play the game, simply compile the source code using the provided Makefile and run the executable. Use the arrow keys to move the player character and push boxes into the storage locations. The game resets when the space bar is pressed.
